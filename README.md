## Key Analyses Performed
  
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and standardized data formats to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

2. **Pivot Table Analysis**:
   - **Average Income by Gender**: Analyzed the average income of individuals who purchased bikes versus those who did not, segmented by gender.
   - **Commute Distance Comparison**: Compared commute distances between those who bought bikes and those who didn't, identifying any correlations.
   - **Count of Bike Purchases by Age Brackets**: Counted the number of bike purchases across various age brackets to identify trends among different age groups.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of bike sales data with the following key insights:

- **Average Income of Bike Buyers**: Displays the average income of those who purchased bikes versus those who did not, visualized with a 3D column chart to provide a clear comparison.
- **Commute Distance by Purchase Status**: Uses line graphs with markers to illustrate how commute distance correlates with bike purchasing decisions, highlighting patterns in travel needs among buyers and non-buyers.
- **Bike Purchases by Age Bracket**: Shows the count of bike purchases across different age brackets using line graphs with markers, revealing which age groups are most likely to buy bikes.

### Interactive Filters
- **Marital Status**: Filter by marital status (Married or Single) to explore how this factor impacts bike purchasing.
- **Region**: Filter by region to examine geographic variations in bike sales.
- **Education**: Filter by education level to analyze how education affects purchasing decisions.
